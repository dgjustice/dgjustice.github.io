    "## P-series convergence\n",
    "I had fun studying infinite series in Calculus, but got stuck on on p-series convergence for some reason.  At the time, I could not think of an intuitive reason that the series diverges for p â‰¤ 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a quick recap.  The p-series is defined as:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^p}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's look at p = 3.  The first six terms of the sequence are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{1^3}+\\frac{1}{2^3}+\\frac{1}{3^3}+\\frac{1}{4^3}+\\frac{1}{5^3}+\\frac{1}{6^3}...$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$1+\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{27}+\\frac{1}{64}+\\frac{1}{125}+\\frac{1}{216}...$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when p = 1, it is clear that the limit of the series approaches zero since the denominator gets infinitely large for p > 0.  Keep in mind that even though the limit exists and is not infinite, *the sum of the series may not converge!*\n",
    "\n",
    "Work in progress.  To be continued..."
