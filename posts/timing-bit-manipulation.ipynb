    "I need a function that counts how many 1-bits are set in an unsigned integer.\n",
    "My initial thought was to not even consider Python's `bin` function because my assumption was that anything in string-land would be inherently slower.\n",
    "I don't necessarily need this to be blazingly fast, but there is no sense writing extra code if I don't need it.\n",
    "Thankfully, Python has a wonderful module called [`timeit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html) that is great for these sorts of tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "I picked up Hacker's Delight by Henry S. Warren, Jr. a few months ago, and it is full of bit-twiddling greatness.\n",
    "I have transposed the C code to Python below, and I really thought it would blow the doors off the other two.\n",
    "It is an order of magnitude faster than my initial creation, but the simple one-liner is the fastest!"
