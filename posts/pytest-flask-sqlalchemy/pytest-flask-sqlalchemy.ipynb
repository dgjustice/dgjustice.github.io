    "\n",
    "[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a popular web framework in Python that is commonly used to build many kinds of web projects.  It is pretty easy to hack together everything from small websites to REST API's by leveraging a litany of available extentions ([Flask-Restful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Flask-Restplus](https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Flask-SQLAlchemy](http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/latest/), etc.).  A very common combination is to use Flask with SQLAlchemy as the ORM.  At some point in your career, you are probably going to be required to write tests, whether these are unit tests or integration tests.  This may be dictated by project requirements or simply to reduce the complexity of finding bugs in your own code.  \n",

I will be using this [repository](https://github.com/dgjustice/flask_pytest) throughout this post.  We will use yet another messaging app, but this one has much less functionality than other examples you have seen.  There is a single GET method (`show_messages`) that returns a list of messages mapped to an *authenticated* user.  The user object is attached to `Flask.g` when the `login_required` decorator fires.  \n",

The database provider is not relevant here since we are focused on interaction with the ORM, not what is under the covers.  The app factory method is located in [`src/app.py`](https://github.com/dgjustice/flask_pytest/blob/rough_draft/src/app.py).  "

    "The easist, fastest way to get started with testing your Flask application is have all of the components in place and test the entire system.  Many developers start the coding process with a test database that contains replicas of production data.  This makes debugging as you code pretty simple and has the advantage of working with \"real\" objects.  You might even have an SQL script that sets up tables in a fresh DB instance before the tests are run.  I have written a Python script that uses the ORM to load our test objects into the SQLite instance.  It is located at [`tests/load_db_data.py`](https://github.com/dgjustice/flask_pytest/blob/rough_draft/tests/load_db_data.py).  Our test runner lives in [`tests/test_messages.py`](https://github.com/dgjustice/flask_pytest/blob/rough_draft/tests/test_messages.py).  I wrote a fixture (similar to unittest's `setUp`) that loads the DB and creates and application instance.  This fixture is passed to each of the test methods.  Here's our first test:  \n",

    "    assert b'\"user\": \"foo\"' in rv.data\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `test_client` is provided by Flask.  I also like using [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) for integration tests with larger projects.  The auth string is built by base64-encoding a known username and password (setup in the `init_db` method).  These are wrapped up and sent to the application instance and we make assertions based on **known database state**.  That last part is critical because the test cannot run successfully without the database instance existing, and more importantly, containing data relevant to the test.  \n",

We trust that the core developers of Flask and SQLAlchemy have tested their modules; we're more interestd in testing *our own business logic*.  Also, if you are using an on-disk database that lives on a VM that sits in a cloud that sits on spinning hard disks... your tests will be **slow**!  You don't want to shower the Twitter API with automated test calls, either.  How can we avoid these problems, is there a better way?  Yes, but before we look, remember that integration tests are a **critical component** of the overall development process!  They have their place and it is up to you and your team to determine which method is most appropriate for each situation.  "

The techniques are the same regardless of the test framework you are using in Python.  Flask and SQLAlchemy present some unique challenges of their own and sometimes require delicate handling.  In closing, if you are struggling with a mock or return data, take a step back and see if you can factor the troublesome code into another method.  At that point you might be able to simply patch the method instead of the data itself (as in the last example).  I have learned the hard way that testing is much more art than science.
