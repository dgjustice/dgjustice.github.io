    "# Folds and recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently read a [paper by Graham Hutton](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/fold.pdf) on folds and recursion.\n",
    "If you don't care much about functional programming, feel free to disengage now.  ðŸ˜†\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an interesting paper, and I encourage you to give it a read.\n",
    "This article is more squirrel chasing and less about the central thesis of Graham Hutton's work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spoiler alert, Haskell doesn't have `for`, `while`, `do` loops!\n",
    "That leaves tools like `map`, recursions, and `fold` in our toolbox.\n",
    "Recursion can be very expensive, so this paper shows us how to abstract it away with `fold`.\n",
    "One of the examples rewrites `dropWhile` using `fold` instead of recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "dropWhile' p = foldr f v\n",
    "  where f x (ys, xs) = (if p x then ys else x:xs,  x:xs)\n",
    "        v = ([ ],[ ])\n",
    "dropWhile p = fst . dropWhile' p\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It took me a while to unpack what that chunk of code is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Iterate over the list, *in reverse*\n",
    "- Store visited values in `xs`\n",
    "- When the predicate stops firing, flip `xs` into `ys` which has been empty up to this point\n",
    "- The last line returns a *function* that takes a list of values and returns another (filtered) list\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, the list must be finite for this to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## dropWhile in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's mess around with a translation and a couple variants.\n",
    "These are quick-and-dirty examples, missing guardrails."
