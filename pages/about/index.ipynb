    "### About\n",
    "I work as an infrastructure developer.  I am also a student at [APU](http://www.apu.apus.edu/) working on my Bachelor's in Mathematics.  This blog is dedicated to the latter effort.  **I am not a professional mathematician**, so feel free to create Github issues for any errors you encounter.  I will fix them as quickly as possible.  The information here is only intended to be anectdotal - I have **no qualifications** as a teacher or professor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This blog serves as a personal journal of sorts.  I am a tinkerer, and I \"play\" with a lot of different things.  I'm not trying to impress anyone or make it to the top of anyone's RSS feed.  I hope you enjoy what you find here, and I welcome your feedback!\n",
