    "# Functional Programming for Pythonistas\n",
    "\n",
    "There are never-ending arguments in tech communities about things like RDBMS versus no-SQL, or functional programming (FP) versus object-oriented-programming (OOP).\n",
    "My goal here isn't to weigh in on that debate; those dead horses have been beaten by people far smarter than myself.\n",
    "These are all tools.\n",
    "My favorite analogy is this:\n",
    "If you have a giant mechanic's toolbox in front of you and you keep reaching for the crescent wrench, \"you're doing it wrong.\"\n",
    "Let's open up some drawers in that toolbox and play with some different tools to see where they might be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why learn FP\n",
    "\n",
    "This point is important, and it is difficult for me to quantify.\n",
    "There are lots of articles if you search \"Why learn Haskell?\" or \"Why learn functional programming?\".\n",
    "I believe the main benefit is that it changes how you view and approach some problems.\n",
    "When you encounter functional code in the wild, you will see a useful abstraction instead of a chunk of \"code golf\".\n",
    "Functional-style programming gets you to focus on the data and less about the cruft around it.\n",
    "It teaches you to break problems down into really small components, then glue them together to build a solution.\n",
    "Functional programming is heavily inspired by mathematics.\n",
    "Category theory has an important relationship to FP, and it seeks to abstract common patterns across \"families\" of objects.\n",
    "Don't worry, I am not going to get into those weeds in this post.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of my favorite quotes is from the well-known network architect Russ White.\n",
    "[He says](https://www.circleid.com/posts/20171019_network_design_if_you_havent_found_the_tradeoff/), \"If you think you've found a design with no tradeoffs, wellâ€¦ Guess what? **You've not looked hard enough.**\"\n",
    "I believe this is as applicable to network design as it is software development.\n",
    "When discussing programming languages and software design, time is often the tradeoff.\n",
    "Some of the items below can ease your cognitive burden (immutable data structures), and others require some up-front head scratching; things like thinking with types and dealing with side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why OCaml\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are going to burn time learning something, it's best if it is useful in some capacity.\n",
    "When I started sipping the FP Kool-Aid, I chose to learn Haskell.\n",
    "All the cool kids \\[PhD's\\] are doing it!\n",
    "I would like to think that there is room in the automation world for a functional language.\n",
    "Unfortunately, I don't think Haskell is the best choice.\n",
    "Haskell has a steep learning curve, and it complicates common operations in a pursuit of \"purity\".\n",
    "The next contender I looked at is OCaml.\n",
    "It is very similar to Haskell, but it trades purity for pragmatism.\n",
    "Unfortunately, this is my main gripe with the language and one of Python's major shortcomings.\n",
    "Neither language has en explicit mechanism to signal the developer that a side-effect is occurring or that a function call might raise an exception.\n",
    "Despite that, there are many benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compiled: It's straightforward to build tiny containers from binaries.\n",
    "- REPL: `utop`, a great debugging tool.\n",
    "- Impure: This is a double-edged sword as mentioned previously.\n",
    "  - Functions can perform side-effects (print debugging is dead simple unlike Haskell).\n",
    "  - Side effects aren't forcibly bound to monads (don't worry if you don't know what that means).\n",
    "- Strongly typed\n",
    "- Good parsing libraries.  [Menhir](http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/), [Angstrom](https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom), others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Small community\n",
    "- Tiny library pool\n",
    "\n",
    "## Whirlwind tour\n",
